# Chatbot with OpenAI
* I followed instructjions provided by [Chatbot](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-chatbot-with-the-chatgpt-api/)
* Front end functionality is working fine, but I'm unable to communicate with the server and I'm getting an error saying Configuration and OpenAIApi isn't a configurator
* After looking up the error about the configurator, I found out that the code provided in [Chatbot](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-chatbot-with-the-chatgpt-api/) is only compatible with openai version 3.0 and lower.
* I'm now following along with [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmaMQ4Ph6hU) that references [v3 to v4 Migration Guide #217](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/discussions/217) to see if this will provide a solution.
